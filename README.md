# Credit Card Fraud Detection
# Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions through data preprocessing, comprehensive analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. By exploring and modeling transaction data, the project aims to identify patterns and insights to improve fraud detection accuracy.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It includes transaction records with features like amount, time, and anonymized attributes that provide patterns for fraud detection.

# Results
Key findings include the proportion of fraudulent transactions and insights on transaction amount distribution.
The best-performing model accurately distinguishes between fraud and legitimate transactions, providing a foundation for further enhancements in fraud detection.
